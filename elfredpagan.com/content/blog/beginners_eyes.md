As mentioned in my [about](/about) page, I've mostly been focused on iOS development
for the past few years. I have worked on other platforms, mainly Android and
some backend Ruby code, but it is not frequent and it has been a while. I also
have not deployed to a server since using capistrano or fabric a long time ago.
Since I'm on parental leave from work, so I decided to correct that.

I'm taking some time to dig into areas where my skills don't go beyond the
superficial, specifically DevOps and more back end development. I went through
Victor Farcic's [DevOps Toolkit](https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-toolkit),
the PragProg [Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3)
and [Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix) books.
Overall it's been great and I hope to write a bit more about what I've been
learning and maybe compare these to doing mobile development.
